This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks I created while learning Python. It's a collection of practice exercises, basic concepts, and examples â€” no full projects (yet), just learning and exploration.



1)These notebooks are for personal learning and reference.

2)They may contain rough work, incomplete sections, or experimental code.

3)Feel free to explore, learn, or build upon them!
